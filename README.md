:raised_hands: Hi, Iâ€™m Levi Huddleston
I enjoy solving difficult problems related to MLOps. With a background in data engineering, data science, and CI/CD pipelines, I can create an end-to-end solution to find accurate and meaningful outcomes with your data.

As a consultant most of my coding does not lend itself to be used on a public Github, however there are a few examples of work I can share that I developed outside client work.     
  - simon_says: Building a chatbot with NLTK & Keras
  - data_tsa: Data profiling utility (built in collaboration with Greg Wilson!)
  - Data-Quality: Data quality python / pyspark scripts built in Databricks. Since they were originally created in Databricks the HTML version is much prettier! DM if you want to see what the work looked like in all its glory!
